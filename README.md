# TensorFlow-model

This is a group project which we are asked to do by our college.
The topic of this project is Real Camera Image Detection.
Open this file in sublimetext and launch this with local server. 
Then install the ngrok.exe in inorder to tunnel your code and open the link provided by ngrok in your android smartphones.
Pose the camera in front of any thing and then it will predict what thing is it and upto how many percent is the detection right.
